This is the central GitHub organization for **RMage**, a full-stack, production-grade rent management application built with modern, industry-standard practices.

## üöÄ About The Project

RMage is designed to streamline the rental process for both landlords and tenants. The project's primary goal is not just to build a functional application, but to do so while adhering to professional engineering disciplines, including Test-Driven Development (TDD), Behavior-Driven Development (BDD), and a complete CI/CD pipeline.

This entire development journey is being documented in public as a case study in building high-quality software.

## üìä Project Management & Roadmap

We believe in transparent and organized development. You can follow our progress, see our current tasks, and view our complete feature backlog on our public project board.
